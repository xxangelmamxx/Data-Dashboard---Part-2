# Web Development Project 5 - *Data Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Abha Mam**

This web app: **This is a responsive Weather Dashboard that displays weather forecast data fetched from the WeatherBit API. It presents forecast days in a visually appealing layout, a moving gradient background, and dynamic white particles (via particles.js) that add a modern touch. The dashboard includes summary statistics (total forecast days, mean temperature, maximum temperature), a search bar to filter the forecast by date or weather description, and an additional temperature filter to display forecast days above a specified temperature.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total
